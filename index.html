						<p>Zoe and Mike met in the winter of 2013.</p>
						<p>If not for a Kanye West concert in Scotland, the two might have met four years earlier on the banks of Seine in Paris.</p>
						<p>They could have fallen in love in November of 2008 while both staying at the St Christopher's Inn, shared macarons and champagne and strolled down the Champs-Élysées.</p>
						<p>But a Kanye West concert dragged Mike to Scotland while Zoe left the nation’s rain-drenched shores to celebrate her 20th birthday in the city of lights. A few days later when Mike finally arrived in Paris, Zoe had gone.</p>
						<p>Instead of meeting under the Eiffel Tower they met on the eighth floor of the American Woolen building. It was not ‘love at first sight’ it took them months of getting to know each other before Mike took Zoe on their first date to Pete’s Tavern, but for both, it's been a whirlwind of romance ever since.</p>
						<p>Whether Mike was following Zoe to Tokyo or she was dragging him to see the northern lights in Iceland or the two were packing their sunscreen for Cuba they have committed to seeing the world together and sharing a life full of adventure.</p>
						<p>So Mike when asked Zoe to marry him in Rome, a city he thinks of as a second home, under the shadow of the Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi for her there was only one answer.</p>
						<p>Join us on September 29, 2018, to find out what it is.</p>
