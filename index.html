						<p>Zoe and Mike met in the winter of 2013.</p>
						<p>If not for a Kanye West concert in Scotland, the two might have met four years earlier on the banks of Seine in Paris.</p>
						<p>They could have fallen in love in November of 2008 while both staying at the St Christopher's Inn, shared macarons and champagne and strolled down the Champs-Élysées.</p>
						<p>But a Kanye West concert dragged Mike to Scotland while Zoe left the nation’s rain-drenched shores to celebrate her 20th birthday in the city of lights. A few days later when Mike finally arrived in Paris, Zoe had gone.</p>
						<p>Instead of meeting under the Eiffel Tower they met on the eighth floor of the American Woolen building. It was not ‘love at first sight’ it took them months of getting to know each other before Mike took Zoe on their first date to Pete’s Tavern, but for both, it's been a whirlwind of romance ever since.</p>
						<p>Whether Mike was following Zoe to Tokyo or she was dragging him to see the northern lights in Iceland or the two were packing their sunscreen for Cuba they have committed to seeing the world together and sharing a life full of adventure.</p>
						<p>So Mike when asked Zoe to marry him in Rome, a city he thinks of as a second home, under the shadow of the Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi for her there was only one answer.</p>
						<p>Join us on September 29, 2018, to find out what it is.</p>

									<h2>FAQs</h2>
								</header>
							</div>

							<div class="12u 12u(narrower) faq-content">
								<h3>What is the dress code?</h3>
								<p>Black tie optional. It’s a wedding and to Mike and Zoe, that means a great chance to pull out your fancy dresses or your smartest jacket. Hey, that’s what they’ll be wearing. Tuxes, kilts, and suits are welcome so are gowns and cocktail dresses. Remember this is a full day event and uncomfortable shoes are no excuse for not dancing so remember to keep your feet happy!</p>

								<h3>How will I get to the venue?</h3>
								<p>Mike and Zoe have hired school buses to pick up guests from the main hotels/guesthouses. They will act as a shuttle to and from the evening reception. You will have to get yourself to and from the ceremony at St. Joan of Arc church. Check back for a route closer to the date.  There are taxi but a limited number. It recommended that you book in advance.</p>

								<h3>What is the schedule for the day?</h3>
								<p>The ceremony begins promptly at 2:30pm at St. Joan of Arc Church. It will be about one hour long. There is a two-hour break before the reception, while Zoe and Mike take photos with their wedding party. Guest can return to their hotels to freshen up or check out some of the local sights. Remember to head back to the hotels if you want to get the shuttle.  The reception begins at 5:30pm at the Captain Linnell House. A cocktail reception will be followed by dinner and then dancing.</p>

								<h3>What else is there to do in Cape Cod?</h3>
								<p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">So much!  Here are just a few ideas:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Beaches &mdash; the beaches and dunes of the cape are beautiful but remember they can be chilly in September.</li>
									<li>Bike riding &mdash; Cape Cod has 22-miles of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.capecodchamber.org/bike-paths">paved well-maintained bike trails</a>. You can rent bikes right in Orleans town center from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.idletimesbikes.com/">Idle Times Bike Shop</a>.</li>
									<li>Orleans town center has a number of cute stores including <a target="_blank" href="https://www.vintageinvogue.com/">Vintage in Vogue</a> and the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hotchocolatesparrow.com/">Hot Chocolate Sparrow coffee shop</a>.</li>
									<li>Provincetown &mdash; on the tip of Cape Cod P-town is something very special - part quaint seaside town part queer haven. It’s about a 25-minute drive from Orleans. Stroll down the rainbow lined streets, chat up a few drag queens on Mainstreet and drink with a couple of fisherman at Old Colony Tap and enjoy some of Tim's famous clam chowder at the Lobster pot.</li>
								</ul>

								<h3>I have dietary issues and want to make sure the couple is aware</h3>
								<p>If you are a vegetarian, vegan, or have a food allergy you can make a note in the comment section when you RSVP (be sure to leave your name next to it). You can also email/text/call Zoe or Mike. But know that the Captain Linnell House can accommodate requests for vegetarian/vegan meals and allergies on the day.</p>
